<h3>About App:</h3>
        <p>Enoch Social Meta commerce platform engages in four principal ways, via brands , influencers, creators and gaming :
 			Content-driven: Unique content created by brands, influencers or individuals drives authentic discovery, engagement, and action. For example, Enoch users are discovering new goods and experiences via shoppable posts and in-app stores on Enoch.
			<br/>
			Experience-driven: Enoch is experience driven , we  enable shopping within an overall experience, most commonly livestreaming, For example Enoch Citizen is a large number of hand made avatars that  create a new way for people to enter Enoch’s  metaverse  via augmented reality. 
			<br/>
 			Network-driven: Users are harnessing their social networks on Enoch to buy and/or sell. That could mean getting together to procure bulk discounts from Enoch’s marketplace online shops or it could mean individuals using their influence and network to drive sales and earn commissions. 
			<br/>
			Social Gaming : Players play the game and try to make the best possible bet to increase their wining size.They can then use their winnings to earn yield on NFTs staking. 
			<br/>
			When you stake an NFT, the staking platform determines its worth based on the rarity and arrives at an annual percentage yield (APY). The rarer your NFT, the higher the APY you get. The value of an NFT also depends upon its capacity to generate a stable revenue stream such as royalties. 
			<br/>
			Additionally players spin the bonus reels to try and win even more play money. Every month, Enoch Entertainment dishes out more than $100,000-worth of actual prizes. Featuring different mini-games, challenges, and leaderboards, the app creates even more opportunities to have fun, compete against others, and win virtual currency and real-world prizes.
